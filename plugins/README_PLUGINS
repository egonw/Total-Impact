Plugins are independent and fully encapsulated in their subdirectories.
Plugins need to meet the API described at https://github.com/mhahnel/Total-Impact/wiki/Plugin-requirements

Many of these plugins will return sample input and output test by calling the plugins with no arguments.  Those implemented in python can be run en masse with this command:

for p in ./*/plugin.py; do python "$p"; done
